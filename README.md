# KAPE-Enterprise-Automation
KAPE and Autopsy based enterprise wide automated and real-time Incident Response and Full disk forensics data collection, processing and presentation
	

The idea is to create an open source and freely available tools and techniques based, enterprise-wide automated incident Response and Digital Forensics project to automate the real time data collection, procession and presenting results in a faster and clear way, that could easily be integrated with existing enterprise systems viz: 

1> Sinkhole: DNS/IP based malware identification in real-time

2> SIEM: Enterprise log management alerting and and analysis system

3> Threat Intel tool: MISP

4> Ticketing Systems like: ServiceNow and other

5> Fireeye (EMPS/WMPS): Email and web based malware system

6> etc.

And use open source and Autopsy (solr-based) for full disk forensics in an automated way. I completed this project in mid 2020, reworking on this project to refine it further, and make it available to organizations, who are looking for: 

1> a real time evidence collection, processing and fast analysis in a automated way,

2> could easily be integrated with existing DFIR setup and enhance the real time analysis of incidents.

3> who canâ€™t afford the costly enterprise-grade Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) products

4> Full disk forensics using open source and freely available tools

They could simply use this open-source and freely available tools-based project, project to automate the entire DFIR response within the organization. 

Note: The best part of this project is that it could allow covert data collection from any system under your control irrespective of its geographic location.

# KAPE-And-Autopsy-Enterprise-Automation
KAPE and Autopsy based enterprise wide automated and real-time Incident Response and Full disk forensics data collection, processing and presentation
	

The idea is to create an open source and freely available tools and techniques based, enterprise-wide automated incident Response and Digital Forensics project to automate the real time data collection, procession and presenting results in a faster and clear way, that could easily be integrated with existing enterprise systems viz:  Sinkhole, SIEM, Threat Intel tool, Ticketing Systems, Threat Detection and response Tools etc. And use open source and Autopsy (solr-based) for full disk forensics in an automated way. I completed this project in mid 2020> Te best features of the project are:  

	1> a real time evidence collection, processing and fast analysis in a automated way,

 	2> could easily be integrated with existing DFIR setup and enhance the real time analysis of incidents.
	
 	3> who canâ€™t afford the costly enterprise-grade Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) products
	
 	4> Full disk forensics using open source and freely available tools

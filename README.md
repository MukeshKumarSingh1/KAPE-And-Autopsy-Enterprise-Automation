**Enterprise-Wide Automated Incident Response and Full Disk Forensics using Open Source Tools**

Welcome to the KAPE-And-Autopsy-Enterprise-Automation project — a practical, open-source guide to building a scalable, automated, and cost-effective Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) system using KAPE and Autopsy (Solr-powered). Designed for real-time incident response and deep-dive forensic investigations across enterprise environments, this project eliminates the high costs typically associated with commercial DFIR solutions.

**🧠 Project Overview**

This project provides a blueprint for automating forensic evidence collection, processing, and analysis across an enterprise, using freely available tools like KAPE. The system is designed to:

✅ Automate real-time data collection and processing using KAPE and open-source scripts.

✅ Integrate with existing enterprise systems, such as:

	SIEMs

 	Threat Intelligence Platforms
	
 	Ticketing Systems (e.g., ServiceNow)
	
 	Threat Detection & Response Tools
	
 	Sinkholes and other telemetry collectors

✅ Enable full disk forensic analysis using Autopsy, powered by Solr, in an automated, scalable manner.

✅ Support organizations without access to expensive commercial DFIR solutions.

Originally developed and completed in mid-2020, this project remains a powerful and practical solution for organizations seeking a modular, automated DFIR workflow.
